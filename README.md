## Project 1: Prediction of purchases in the supermarket
The aim of the project is to compare which of the methods best predicts whether a person with certain characteristics will  make a purchase in the supermarket X. I used such classifiers as **Decission Trees**, **Random Forest** and **k-Nearest Neighbors**. 
Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall an ROC curve were used to evaluate the quality of classifiers. 

At the beggining, I split data into training data and testing data. I used 20% of data for testing and 80% for training. Dataset was Decission Trees turned out to be the best classifier.
